'''
If the order of your data matters, then use a LIST.

If you want to store an immutable (unchangeable) list of data, then use a TUPLE.

If you need to associate values with keys so you can look up data efficiently, then you should use a DICTIONARY.

If you just need to know if you already have a particular piece of data, order doesnâ€™t matter, and you need not keep duplicates, then use a SET.
